# Project A2 - Word Embeddings
- Dataset: synonym.csv

- Main tasks:
0. Contribution to a Collective Human Gold-Standard.
1. Evaluation of the word2vec-google-news-300 pre-trained model.
2. Comparison with other pre-trained models.
3. Train our own models.

- Files:
1. COMP472-A2.ipynb: This notebook is divided into several parts (Import necessary libraries/modules, Functions (this part contains the functions that we created to perform the project correctly and in an organized manner (def model_evaluator(model, dataset), def output_df(output_data, model_name), def compute_accuracy(output_df), def save_data(analysis_dic, model_name, model, output_data), and def preprocess_books(books)), and Tasks).

- **Instructions**: Run the "COMP472-A2.ipynb" file to perform all of the tasks. Make sure you have the dataset in a folder called "A2-Dataset" and all of the books in a folder called "Books".
